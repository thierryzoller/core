The message center groups all the important posts that you
must watch. It is next to the time at the top right.

It is only accessible when there are posts, by clicking on the
number of posts.

It is quite simple. It shows you the date and time of the message, the
plugin that issued it and the message in question. You can, by pressing
on the button at the very beginning of a message line, delete the
message in question (it will come back if the problem is still
news).

At the top, there is a selector to filter posts on a
particular plugin and all right a button to empty all
posts.
