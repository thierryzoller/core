Views simply allow you to create a custom view. This
is not as powerful as the designs but it allows in a few
minutes to have a more personalized display.

The views are accessible from the Home → View menu :

The views 
========

We can also put widgets, graphics (which can be
composed of several data) or table fields (which contain the
command widgets).

On this page, there is a button at the top left to show or
hide the list of views and the button to add one
(Jeedom will ask for its name and send you to the edit page) :

> **Tip**

> You can modify this option in your profile so that the list
> views to be visible by default.

A button at the top right allows you to edit the current view.

Adding / Editing a view 
=======================

The principle is quite simple : a view is made up of areas (you can
put as much as you want). Each zone is of graphic type, widget
or table, depending on the type you can put widgets
of equipment, control or graphics in it.

> **Tip**
>
> You can move the order of the zones by dragging and dropping.

On the left of the page we find the list of views and a
add button.

In the center you have a button to rename a view, an add button
of zone, a button to see the result, a button to save and
a button to delete the view.

After clicking on the add zone button, Jeedom will ask you
his name and type.

On each zone you have the following general options :

-   **Width** : defines the width of the area (in mode
    desktop only)

-   **Edit** : allows to change the name of the zone

-   **Remove** : allows to delete the zone

A widget type area allows you to add widgets :

-   **Add widget** : add / edit widgets to

> trash can in front of this one.

> **Tip**
>
> It is possible to change the order of widgets in the area by
> drag / drop.

Once the add widget button is pressed, you get a window
which will ask you for the widget to add
