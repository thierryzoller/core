Edit mode 
============

In edit mode, you can change the size of the widgets and their
layout on the dashboard.

You can also edit the internal layout of the widget controls
:

-   either reorganize them by dragging and dropping

-   either by right-clicking on the widget. You then access :

    -   **Advanced configuration** : gives access to the configuration
        order progress

        with just the ability to rearrange the order of orders

    -   **Board** : allows to put the commands in a table :
        columns and rows are added and removed by click
        right then just move the controls within
        desired boxes. You can put multiple orders per box

    -   **Add column** : add a column to the table (accessible
        only if you are in a table layout)

    -   **Add line** : add a row to the table (accessible
        only if you are in a table layout)
