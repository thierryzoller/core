This page allows you to see all the reports that have been generated by the report action (see scenario documentation).

# What is a report ?

A report is a screenshot of the Jeedom interface at an instant T (the capture is adapted so as not to take the menu bar and other unnecessary element on this type of use).

You can do this on views, design, panel page....

It is triggered from a script with the report command, you can choose to have this report sent to you using a message command (email, telegram....)

# Utilisation

Its use is very simple you select if you want to see :

-	view reports
-	degins reports
-	plugin panel reports
- Equipment reports (for a summary of the battery of each module)

Then you select the name of the report in question then you will see all the dates of the reports in memory

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Automatic deletion is done by default for reports longer than 30 days (you can configure this period in the configuration of Jeedom)

Once the report selected you can see it appear, redownload it or delete it.

You can also delete all backups of a given report
