# What is a report ?

A report is a screenshot of the Jeedom interface at an instant T (the capture is adapted n as not to take the menu bar and other useless element on this type of use).

You can do this on views, design, panel page....

It is triggered from a script with the report command, you can choose to have this report sent to you using a message command (email, telegram, etc.)

# Use

- Equipment reports (for a summary of the battery for each module)

Then you select the name of the report in question then you will see all the dates of the reports in memory
